# about me

<img style="float: left;" src="publpics/ice_cream.jpg"/> 

I'm a PhD student at Tufts University studying mathematics. I'm interested in applied math, more specifically scientific computing and numerical linear algebra. I received a BS in applied and computational math from Brigham Young University, where I also minored in gender studies. As an undergraduate I did research with Dr. Tyler Jarvis about Rootfinding for systems of multivariate equations—with a numerical analysis flavor. When I'm not doing math, I love to read books and sew. I have the best cat to ever exist, Moose, and I live to dote on him. I also love things in nature like wildflowers, frogs, bats, and snakes.
